            </div>
                <h2>Initial Idea</h2>
                    <p>Upon receiving the brief to design a magazine for a topic of our choice, I wanted to try to design for a niche interest in order to explore something outside of my comfort zone. After brainstorming for several ideas, I decided to research more on the topic of aliens and thus leading to the idea of a conspiracy theory magazine. I envisioned a spoof news magazine with exaggerated, clickbait headlines in a similar sense to Weekly World News. This project allowed me to have fun while designing and gain some knowledge about something I have never done before.</p>
                    <p>*DISCLAIMER: The headlines and content of this magazine do not represent my beliefs towards any listed conspiracy theory nor my endorsement of any such views. It is not a means of credible information whatsoever. </p>

                <h2>Target Readership</h2>
                    <p>In order to identify the target audience, I was tasked with researching similar brands within the  domain to gain insights on the typical readership. Due to the nature of the content I planned to deliver, I started with <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">Media Bias Fact Check</a> and took inpsiration from the media kits of brands such as <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Commentary_Media-Kit_2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">Commentary Magazine</a>, <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reason-Media-Kit-2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">Reason</a>, and Skeptic Magazine. Moreover, to get a clearer sense of the reader’s habits and values, I created a persona based on <a href="https://prizm.environicsanalytics.com/" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">PRIZM’s Environics Analytics</a> market segment "<a href="https://downloads.esri.com/esri_content_doc/dbl/int/canada_prizm/38.pdf" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">Stressed in Suburbia</a>".</p>

                    <p class="caption">Target audience and potential reader persona for the magazine.</p>

                <h2>Editorial Mandate</h2>
                    <p>STRVNGER Magazine aims to provide serious content on prevailing world issues and news. Tackling new takes on politics and sciences, it questions socially accepted truths and investigates deeper to explore alternative possibilities of events past and present. Their readers are perceptive and skeptic, and can turn to the magazine for meticulous stories that interconnect our society. It is the leading brand in the age of an emerging culture, pushing boundaries of the conspiracy community into the mainstream.</p>

                <div class="section-name"><h4>Design Process</h4></div><div class="divider-line"></div>
            </div>
                <h2>Brainstorming for a Title</h2>
                    <p>Selecting a proper name for the magazine was the next step before starting the design process. The name would have to represent the voice and content that the magazine covered. I brainstormed through mindmapping any key words related to conspiracy theories before selecting a few that stood out. </p>

                    <p class="caption">A mindmap of words related to conspiracy theories to choose a title.</p>
                <h2>Iterating the Nameplate and Cover</h2>
                    <p>After selecting some titles, I went through several iterations of the cover page and nameplate designs. I wanted it to be easily readable and recognizable. The cover lines would also be straightforward, attention grabbing, and slightly exaggerated, almost like clickbait.

                    I decided to add a sidebar and images to them to create a preview of inside articles. The overall design of the cover is busy, as a news magazine commonly is.
                        
                    However, for the feature section, I wanted it to have a different tone from the rest of the cover, using a different font to set apart a mysterious tone and encourage readers to want to open the feature. The image of a single UFO is simple, empty, and blurry to match the tone also.</p>

                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                    <p>For the final deliverables, I was tasked with designing a cover, table of contents, and the feature story layouts. Part of this was finding placeholder content of stories that the magazine would publish. The feature story was taken and edited from <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/19/20857221/storm-area-51-aliens-ufos-meme-myth-lore-history-bob-lazar-explained" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">Vox's </a> "Area 51 and aliens: the myth, the meme, and the strange reality, explained”.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>I was a bit unsure of this project at first and struggled a lot with the initial research surrounding the target audience demographic. There was not a lot of information or sample media kits for the specific kind of content I was trying to cover. However, I received a lot of helpful feedback from the professor and peers and was able to confidently move forward by focusing the art direction towards the genre as well as tone of voice I was trying to convey. </p>
