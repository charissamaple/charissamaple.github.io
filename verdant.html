For this project, we were placed with the task of establishing a domain to research and work within to propose a meaningful design intervention.</h3>

                    <p>Our team decided to explore the domain of environmental awareness due to the growing issue of global warming and carbon dioxide emissions. In order to better understand the domain and potential areas for intervention, we conducted a survey. This would help us to gain a sense of the current relationship individuals share with the environment and how they perceive their environmental impact. Our primary research allowed us to gather diverse responses from over 50 participants with ages ranging from 18-61 years old.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Domain of study and audience insights.</p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                    <div class="in-text-h3-flex">
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3 number">01</h3>
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3">Carbon footprint is more than transportation emissions</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>When thinking of carbon footprint, individuals tend to associate their transportation methods with how positive or negative their impact is. However, there are other factors, such as purchases, that must be taken into consideration when calculating one’s overall carbon dioxide emission.</p>
                    <div class="in-text-h3-flex">
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3 number">02</h3>
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3">Eager to change, but unaware of how to</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>A common theme amongst the respondes was their willingness to change their lifestyle and take action to prevent further damage to the environment. However, they were unsure of exactly how their life currently impacts the Earth and what measures they should take to live more environmentally friendly.</p>

                <h2>Framing our Design Approach</h2>
                    <p>Taking insights gained from our research, we narrowed our scope to focus on personal carbon dioxide emissions. With this clear direction, we established an end goal of ensuring that the design would be able to inform users of their carbon dioxide emissions in efforts to help reduce their personal carbon footprint. As a result, we as a team proposed the question:</p>
                    <div class="image-div">
                        <img src="images/verdant/design-focus.png" alt="A 'how might we' question that frames our design.">
                    </div>
                    <p class="caption">Our established "How might we" question to narrow our design focus.</p>

            <div class="section-divider ux">
                <div class="section-name"><h4>Design Process</h4></div><div class="divider-line"></div>
            </div>
                <h2>Initial Proposal</h2>
                    <p>After a rapid brainstorming session, our group decided to move forward with a carbon footprint tracking application. From the research and insights collected, we gathered data to create a persona that would better represent our potential users. In order to envision how our persona would interact with this type of system, we formulated a journey map to see potential touchpoints that we could use to drive the design of our application.</p>
                    <div class="image-div">
                        <img src="images/verdant/persona.png" alt="Our user persona with their short bio, goals and motivations.">
                    </div>
                    <p class="caption">User persona with their short background, goals, and motivations. </p>

                    <div class="image-div">

                    <p class="caption">User experience map for our persona's journey with our proposed area of intervention.</p>

                <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
                    <p> After formulating the persona’s journey map, the team split up to iterate several versions of the
                        application through wireframing and mapping out wireflows. I worked heavily on the profile page
                        and data visualization of the user’s carbon emissions. With each iteration, the main carbon footprint graph as well as the display of the emission breakdown was experimented with to explore what would be most appropriate for the type of data given to the user.</p>
                    <div class="image-div">
                        <img src="images/verdant/iterations.png" alt="Iterations of the home page design over three stages.">
                    </div>
                    <p class="caption">Some of the screens from the home page that I had worked on throughout each iteration. </p>


                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                    <p>Before being able to finalize the design, we conducted user testing to gather insights and
                        feedback on the core workflows of our application. This was done by video interview (Zoom)
                        with 14 participants using screen sharing to observe how they explored the application as a first
                        time user to monitor how they naturally reacted with the design. Additionally, users were given
                        key tasks to complete within the application. The user-testing allowed us to discover any
                        concerns or thoughts that users had with our designs.</p>
                    <div class="in-text-h3-flex">
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3 number">01</h3>
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3">Lack of context</h3>
                    </div>
                        <p>Users were given a large amount of data and unlabeled numbers that they were unable to understand. They were also confused whether the values should be interpreted as positive or negative since they were given no basis of comparison or recommended value.</p>
                    <div class="in-text-h3-flex">
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3 number">02</h3>
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3">Too many features</h3>
                    </div>
                        <p>Our initial design did not feel as cohesive due us introducing many possible user flows without one clear end goal. For this reason, the core feature of tracking user’s carbon dioxide emissions felt incomplete. We would need to reduce clutters of information to put more focus on improving the experience of logging emission activities.</p>
                    <div class="in-text-h3-flex">
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3 number">03</h3>
                        <h3 class="in-text-h3">Not fully inclusive options</h3>
                    </div>
                        <p>For logging transportation emissions, there were not enough options provided in regards to how people travel, whether it be through carpooling, driving more than one vehicle, or using a motorcycle as opposed to using a regular vehicle.</p>

                <p>For Verdant, I was excited that we chose to work in the domain of environmental awareness, as it was an area that I had previously been interested in but had not done a project directed at the issue before. My team and I initially struggled with understanding the details of how carbon footprint was calculated and in turn did a lot of secondary research related to the matter. I enjoyed being able to see our progress over each design iteration alongside the feedback received from user testing. I was overall satisfied with the final product that the team was able to complete!
